### Thread Lifecycle Flow

1. New State: A thread is created, but it hasn't been started yet.


2. Runnable State: The start() method is invoked. The thread is eligible to run but will be executed only when the thread scheduler assigns it CPU time.


3. Blocked State: If the thread is waiting for a resource (like a lock), it enters the blocked state.


4. Waiting State: A thread is waiting for another thread to perform some actions (for example, it may call join() or wait()).


5. Timed Waiting State: The thread is waiting for a specified time period before resuming execution.


6. Terminated State: Once the thread finishes executing its run() method or is interrupted, it enters the terminated state.
